### Hi, I'm Rajesh Kongath
---------------------------------------------------
Just another chubby mallu IT guy from God's Own Country - Kerala, India.

I'm into all kind of computer networking, wired, wireless, software defined, you name it lol.. 

I'm improving my NetDevOps skills and github and internet community helped me alot, i wish to payback ;)

When i'm not doing digital networking, i do social networking with my ADV riding buddies in the beautiful deserts and off-roads of QATAR.

And if that wasnâ€™t enough to keep me busy â€” Iâ€™m also the father of two wonderful kids and married to the most beautiful lady on the planet.
